# Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization: Course 2

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the second course in Andrew Ng's **Machine Learning Specialization** on Coursera: **Advanced Learning Algorithms**.

The goal of this course is to build upon the foundational concepts from Course 1 and dive into more advanced models and algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and advanced optimization techniques.

## Course Content

### **Week 1: Neural Networks**
* **Topics:** Introduction to the neural network architecture, the single-neuron model, and the intuition behind hidden layers.
* **Assignment:** Building a neural network for a classification problem.

### **Week 2: Neural Network Training**
* **Topics:** The role of activation functions, forward and backward propagation, and advanced optimization algorithms for training neural networks.
* **Assignment:** Implementing and training a neural network from scratch.

### **Week 3: Advice for Applying Machine Learning**
* **Topics:** Best practices for machine learning development, diagnosing model performance, and understanding the bias-variance tradeoff.
* **Assignment:** Using learning curves to debug and improve a machine learning model.

### **Week 4: Decision Trees and Ensembles**
* **Topics:** Building and training decision trees, and combining them into powerful ensemble models like Random Forests.
* **Assignment:** Constructing and applying a decision tree to a classification problem.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The primary programming language for all assignments.
* **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and linear algebra.
* **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **scikit-learn**: Used for its robust machine learning tools and utilities.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.

## How to Run the Code

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the repository folder.
3.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all your libraries.)*
4.  Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment and run the cells.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank **Andrew Ng** and **DeepLearning.AI** for providing this exceptional learning experience.
